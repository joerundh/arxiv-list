      <p>Paper Trail allows you to store references to scientific papers, or really any kind of article or link with a title and a description (with scientific papers, one refers rather to "abstracts"). Heck, it can even be used just as a personal note keeper, should one be bothered to come up with a link and a title to add to every note one makes.</p>
      <p>All notes that are made public by the entree are available to any viewer, logged in or not. In order to add one's own entries, however, one needs to sign up and be logged in. It is also possible to have one's enties not shown on the "Latest" page. This can be adjusted in the editor.</p>
      <p>Note that just because someone has entered a paper here, does not in any case imply that they are the author of one of the authors of that paper. This is just for personal record-keeping, with the option of sharing it with others. Strictly speaking, one should include the names of a paper's authors when referring to it, certainly in the fashion here. However, with a link available, they can easily be looked up thusly. And for the purposes here, there is little point in mucking it up too much for the sake of formality.</p>
